  <h1>Wes Music Map</h1>
  <p>
  This site was made by Matt Adelman, Julian Applebaum, Aaron Rosen, and Aaron Plave during the Wesleyan 2013 Senior Week Hackathon.
  </p>
  <p>
  WesMusicMap lets you tag songs that meant something to you in the places you heard them. You can listen to your songs as well as other people's by clicking the pins on the map.
  </p>
  <p>
  To tag a song, double click on the location you want to tag and search for your song by name, artist, and/or album. Press enter or click on your song, and it's tagged!
  </p>
  <p>
  To hear songs in a particular area of campus from your desktop, drag and resize the red circle to fit that area. You'll see them all in the white column to the right of the map.
  </p>
  <p>
  When you click on a song in the map, you can play a short sample and view its album art. If the user who posted the song was logged in through Facebook, you'll also see their profile picture.
